Doudou Shelter
----------------

Doudou Shelter provides a home for "doudous" ("soft toy companions" in french).
At Doudou Shelter, anyone can adopt a doudou or give one so that it can be later adopted.
This is a fictional service, meaning you only give or adopt some doudou data and not real stuffed toys.

Doudou Shelter is a small website I built for learning purposes.
It uses React.js for the frontend and Node/Express.js for the backend which contains a MongoDb-based API.

API Documentation
---------------------

The Doudou Shelter API is a REST API providing data about soft toys.
It could be useful to anyone who needs to access to a free API.
I could also be useful to anyone needing inspiration to name their soft toys !
