                <h1>Welcome to the Doudou Shelter</h1>
                <p>The Doudou Shelter is a place where soft toys ("doudous" in french) can rest and await a new owner.</p>
                <p>Here you will find all kinds of soft toys : dogs, cats, penguins, elephants, puppets, birds... Some are old, some are young. There are different genders. There are diffent levels of sotness as well.</p>
                <p>As a visitor, you can either give a doudou or adopt one.</p>
                <p>Giving and adopting a doudou is a FICTIONAL action, meaning you will only give or get digital information about a doudou, nothing more, sorry !</p>
                <p>But if you're willing to share informations about your soft toys or pull some from our database, you're at the right place ðŸ˜‰</p>
